# Python Blockchain

For this project I am creating a blockchain in python so I can better understand
how blockchain works.

I am using the following [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_blockchain/python_blockchain_developing_client.htm).
I have changed the code from the tutorial as I see fit. I have also added doc
strings to the code for my own reference and documentation.


Once I have completed the above tutorial here is another tutorial to check out
and a linkt to some more resources.
